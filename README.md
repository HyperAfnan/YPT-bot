# YPT Analytics Checker

A Node.js & Express service for querying YPT (Yeolpumta) study group analytics without running a timer.

## Features

- **CLI Interactive Authentication**: Prompts for your YPT account email and password when started.
- **Joined Groups Discovery**: Fetches all groups the account belongs to (`/group/groups/v2`) and displays them in a structured table.
- **Unified Single-Grid Member Leaderboard**: Automatically consolidates all members across all joined groups/channels into a single unified grid, deduplicating members who belong to multiple groups while preserving their highest study times, live status, and group memberships.
- **Search Within Joined Groups**: Filter joined groups by name, category, or ID via the Express REST API (`GET /groups?q=...`).
- **Unified Members API**: Query all deduplicated members across all groups/channels (`GET /members`).
- **Live Member Analytics**: Fetch real-time member study durations, ongoing status, and subjects for a specific group (`GET /groups/:groupId/members`).
